1. There is a log file `logfile.txt` that contains the logs of websites user have visited. The log contains N entries and  will be in the format like below

- www.google.com 2012-03-08 /GET MAC123
- www.google.com 2012-03-09 /GET MAC123
- www.twitter.com 2012-03-10 /GET MAC123

Write a program to read the log file and then find unique website requests and its count that indicates how many requests has been made to that site. Write the output to new file as `records_logfile.txt`

In the above example contents written to new file will be 

- www.google.com 2
- www.twitter.com 1

Constraint: `1 < N < (2 * 10 pow 6)`

### Pair Programming round
 
You will be given a problem and you have to solve it in TDD approach. Evaluation criteria is based on coding standards, flexible design with effective use of design principles like Dependency inversion to extract the dependencies to write good unit tests.

**Problem**: You have to implement a number game. User inputs some number and your code generates some random number between 0-9 (this can change). If the number guessed by user matches with the
random number generated then print the score 5, else print 0 (This can change too like at later stages we may want to print date and time along with the score)


### Design Interview

This round was about System and OO Design. You will be given a problem like requirement and you have to solve that in a agile way with the use of good OO design principles and patterns to make your implementation flexible to changes. The below problem statement is an abstract idea and not the
exact problem

**Problem**: You have to design a REST API for a travel platform company. The REST API should fetch the weather information for a specific region and it should also support add/remove functionality. It should be possible to search and sort weather based on lattitude & longitude, location, date & time. It should be also possible to look for the previous date. Your REST API can fetch weather information from multiple sources. Each sources can return the result in different format like text,json and xml. Your REST API should only return JSON. If one of the weather sources for a specific region is down then it should get the weather information from another weather source. It should be also possible to more weather providers.  


### Architecture round

In this round it was discussion on current project that you will be working on and its architecture. Expect many cross questions on your current project architecture, its security, handling the load or why a particular implementation has been done in a particular way, talk about something you have done in your project that you are proud of and so on.

### Client round

This was just general discussion on the current project, architecture, about your role in the current project like you work on backend or frontend or full stack, how do you handle deployment, about CI/CD flow, how do you keep up to date with latest technologies, what techonlogy you like and what not and if you like or interested in particular technology then why is that and so on.About the process you follow like Scrum or Kanban and which do you prefer and why. Expect questions on the projects or achievements you have mentioned on your resume and you should be in a position to talk about your project well. 
Be prepared to ask sensible questions as well when your turn comes.


### HR Round

This was just a brief discussion. They asked about yourself, your company and what they are into, to talk about achievement
